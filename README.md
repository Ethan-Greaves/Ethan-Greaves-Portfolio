## Overview 📖

My portfolio website which showcases my skills/the technologies I know, my projects, and contact/social information. [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) is used as a headless CMS, this is a vast improvement over [my previous portfolio](https://ethan-greaves.github.io/Portfolio/) where all the content was hard-coded. React was used to build the front end which allowed for faster development speed and made website scalability easier.

## Technologies used 👨‍💻

-   React
-   Create React App
-   CSS/SCSS
-   Material-UI
-   JSS
-   JavaScript (ES6)
